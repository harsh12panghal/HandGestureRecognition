# HandGestureRecognition
Trained a Keras neural network to recognize our own custom hand gestures, and that runs flawlessly on a CPU. I  used Mediapipe for extracting hand landmarks (which runs a pipeline of TensorFlow neural nets under the hood), which will allow us to use relatively small training datasets for training on our new custom hand gestures.
